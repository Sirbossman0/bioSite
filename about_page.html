            <p class="intro">
                Jeremy is the middle child among three brothers. If you get to know him, you’ll notice his tone of voice 
                is rather monotonic and he tends to say what he thinks. Sometimes this can range from positive or 
                informative things and other times it’ll come off as rude. As a young child, he was rather rebellious and 
                tended slack off in school due to a lack of interest. To prove that he was very much capable, he easily 
                scored A’s in his last year and passed without issues. However, things improved later on as he took things 
                more seriously.
            </p>

            <p>
                After high school, he went to college and eventually joined the police academy in order to become a cop. 
                After graduation, he became a cop near the city of Houston where he’s worked for 5 years now. Every once 
                in a while he’ll regale us with a tale of a rather wild experience that happened at work. One of his early 
                experiences involved a person who crashed into his car. The front bumper happened to fall off and to this 
                day, he has it hung above the mini-bar inside the house.

                As of this current day, he enjoys his job and experimenting with various DIY projects. These can range 
                from setting up a personal server to fixing a hole in the ceiling. He has current plans to one day soon 
                purchase some land and construct a house from scratch so he can have more control surrounding his home. 
                It is here that he would be able work on various hardware projects with his assortment of tools.
